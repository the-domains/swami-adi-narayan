  The Beloved: A Song of Eternal Love is written in the tradition of the
  greatest poetic mystics, from Hafiz to Walt Whitman. This collection of poems
  to the Beloved can apply to a beloved human, or a divine Beloved accessed

  desperate cries for love. Swami Adi Narayan enjoins us on his journey into his
  interior of most deep and sacred yearnings to become love realized through the
  longing, the trials and suffering, joys, bliss and ecstasy that only true love
  can offer, taking one into the heart of the Divine itself. This book will move
  you with its openhearted pronouncements of undying love that cuts across all
  boundaries of differing cultures and religions, uniting mankind in his one
  pure aspiration and longing for union with the Beloved.

_The Beloved: A Song of Eternal Love_ is written in the tradition of the greatest poetic mystics, from Hafiz to Walt Whitman. This collection of poems to the Beloved can apply to a beloved human, or a divine Beloved accessed through meditation and contemplative practices. Crying out to this unnamed Beloved, Swami Adi Narayan accesses the universal voice of humanity and its desperate cries for love. Swami Adi Narayan enjoins us on his journey into his interior of most deep and sacred yearnings to become love realized through the longing, the trials and suffering, joys, bliss and ecstasy that only true love can offer, taking one into the heart of the Divine itself. This book will move you with its openhearted pronouncements of undying love that cuts across all boundaries of differing cultures and religions, uniting mankind in his one pure aspiration and longing for union with the Beloved.

Swami Adi Narayan is one of the great mystics of our present day. He was born in 1972 in Trinidad & Tobago, West Indies and lived in Toronto, Canada from the age of four. At the tender age of 21, Swami Adi Narayan left home on a journey to answer the call of spiritual self-realization. He entered the ashram of Master Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, who on their very first meeting, uttered the words, "I have been waiting for you." From that moment onwards, Swami Adi Narayan's life was forever altered and placed on a mystical path through their everlasting communion. The bond they shared as Guru and disciple led to a transcendent relationship that would culminate in the emergence of grace and oneness with the Beloved. For many years after their meeting, Swami Adi Narayan led intimate spiritual groups and gatherings, and lived a reclusive life. There he continues to write and teach those in search of the mystical path of love.
