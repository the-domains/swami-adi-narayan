Autistic Boy Begins to Speak After Swami Adi Narayan's Remote Blessing Transmission

"Swami Adi Narayan Ji,

I'm unsure if you still personally check your messages on FB since your departure from it. But I'll send you this message regardless.

We've had a brief conversation on the day before you left (on the 9th day of Navaratri) and I was mentioning to you about my son Pranav and how he needed your blessing more than I do being one of those GOD'S Special Children. You told me you'll keep Pranav in mind at that nights Durga Puja.

I felt SOOOOOOOOO blessed that you were doing that for us from your own good heart. I can tell you this Swami, Pranav who is almost non verbal due to Autism has picked up significantly amount of new words that I've even lost count. I'm not sure if he knows what they means, he's just repeating what I'm asking him to say (he's 5 years old) but I do NOT CARE !!!!! This has been an enormous breakthrough in his life and ours.

Tonight as I was telling him "Goodnight" without me asking, he told me, "Goodnight" with a big smile on his face. My heart couldn't contain and I knew I had to share this news with you.

This is the very same boy who NEVER uttered a word for 4 and a half years of his life. Since 4.5 years he started saying maximum 10 words. Now I can almost make him say any word a 3 year old can say within 2 weeks of your blessings Swamiji.

I feel SO BLESSED and I wanted to share this good news with you. I will continue to work with Pranav along with all the test his neurologist has signed him up for. It's going to be an uphill climb still ; but we are ready with GOD leading our way.

With Utmost Gratitude,"

"I've had pelvic pain for about 2-3 years, but for the last 4 months it was very painful; nerve pain in the pelvic area and headaches. My pain score before the healing was 9, and then after was 5! I received two healings from Swamiji; I found it to be very relaxing and stress-free. After the healing, my doctor told me I can go on vacation! I told him I have stopped all my medications and I just use painkillers when the pain is intense, and he was very much surprised. My overall health status is medium and I'm looking forward to a full recovery in a positive way, by engaging myself in more meaningful health activities. Sai Ram, Thank you."

-- K. Maharaj, Canada

"Late to satsang and rushing to a shady place in my garden, no sooner than giving thanks I folded into a river of light, much like the one I experienced with wonder as a near death experience many years ago. No fear at all, only the magnificent energy of Gods pure unconditional love. Thank you Swamiji for today's blessing."

-- S. Hicks, USA

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Ahh Swami I feel so gifted to be in your presence, such loving kindness. Tonight was interesting for me. I felt something I haven't been aware of before, there was a very subtle vibration-kind of like when electricity is vibrating thru a wire. I felt it begin in my feet and legs and move upward to my heart and head and fill my entire body-energy body. I have not been able to reach the subtleness of this before-to be aware of it. And it is such a blessing to have this meeting of Spirit as it helps me to take the time to be with Self. Much much love to you Swami, and to the rest of the group."

Now, just peace and gratitude for blessings and loving community."

"Your presence was palpable, Swamiji -- firm but inexpressibly gentle hands on my shoulders, all-embracing arms surrounding tenderly. Your image and your name glow in my mind and heart, with Lord Christ and Lord Narayana. Your blessed name engraved in light in my consciousness in dazzling clarity. These were only a few symbolic moments of oh, so much more... I hope I may find words for a part of it in the days to come. Thank you. Bless you! Love and devotion to you!"

-- S. Wood, USA

"To find a Bhakti Yoga Swami in this life such as our dear Adi Ji is in itself an amazing blessing. As he shares the ancient bhakti ways of communal transmission as such Swamis have done for centuries, we all get uplifted toward the focus of all of our bhakti feelings, The Lord Source of All. Jai All Swamis, Swaminis and Adi Ji Narayan."
